#' Statistical Learning based Estimation of Mutual Information (SLEMI). A package for estimating mutual information and channel capacity from experimental data.
#'
#' The package SLEMI is designed to estimate channel capacity between finite 
#' state input and multidimensional output from experimental data. For efficient computations, 
#' it uses iterative algorithm based on logistic regression.
