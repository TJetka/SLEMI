Description: The implementation of the algorithm for estimation of mutual information and channel capacity from experimental data by classification procedures (logistic regression). Technically, it allows to estimate information-theoretic measures between finite-state input and multivariate, continuous output. Method described in Jetka et al. (2019) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007132>.
